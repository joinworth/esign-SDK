# ESIGN SDK

A lightweight JavaScript library that provides a custom web component `<esign-component>` for embedding ESIGN workflows into your web applications.

## Live Demo

Check out the [live demo](https://joinworth.github.io/esign-SDK/example.html)

## Features

- Simple integration with just a few lines of code.
- Customizable attributes for API key and document ID.
- Secure interaction with ESIGN APIs using API keys.
- Built-in UI for initiating signing workflows.
- Developer mode for testing and development

## How It Works

1. Developers include the ESIGN SDK in their application.
2. Add the `<esign-component>` web component to the HTML with `api-key` and `document-id` attributes.
3. The component interacts with your backend ESIGN API to trigger the signing process and provide status feedback.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Include the ESIGN SDK

#### Option 1: CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.yourdomain.com/esign-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Add the Web Component

```html
<!-- Production Mode -->
<esign-component api-key="your-api-key" document-id="12345"></esign-component>

<!-- Developer Mode -->
<esign-component
  api-key="your-api-key"
  document-id="12345"
  dev-mode
></esign-component>
```

### Developer Mode

When the `dev-mode` attribute is present, the SDK will:

- Display a "Dev Mode" indicator
- Mock the signing API calls
- Return simulated successful responses
- Log actions to the console

This is useful for:

- Development and testing
- UI integration work
- Demos and presentations
